## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Here's how to get involved:

### Reporting bugs or requesting features

Use the GitHub Issues tab and select the appropriate template:

- **Bug Report** — describe the problem, steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual behavior.
- **Feature Request** — describe the motivation and your proposed solution.

Blank issues are disabled, so please use a template to ensure all necessary context is provided.

### Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/alexantonica/pr-grouper/fork) and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, ensuring existing tests still pass (`npm test`).
3. If adding new behavior, include tests where appropriate.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. The PR template will guide you through the required information.

### Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Write clear commit messages that describe the "why", not just the "what".
- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions — see our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
